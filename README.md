# Hameln - The Minecraft Trident Innovation Plugin
Hameln is a plugin compatible with Minecraft 1.20 versions, designed to make trident usage more intuitive and convenient. It works seamlessly with Paper, Purpur, and Folia server implementations.

## Key Features
- **Hand Adaptability:** When a trident is thrown with the non-dominant hand (typically the left hand), it returns to that same hand. Similarly, tridents thrown with the dominant hand (typically the right hand) will return to it.
- **Automatic Slot Return:** If you throw a trident with your dominant hand and then switch slots, the trident will return to the new selected slot, provided it is empty.
- **Standard Behavior Retention:** If the trident’s designated slot is not empty upon its return, it will follow Minecraft’s default behavior.
